# Reasoning Knowledge Integration Bug Fixes

This document describes the bugs that were identified in the integration between the Unified Reasoning Core and the Knowledge Graph components, and how they were fixed.

## Overview

The integration between the Unified Reasoning Core and the Knowledge Graph is a critical part of the CCAI Engine architecture. It enables the system to reason about knowledge stored in the Knowledge Graph and to update the Knowledge Graph based on reasoning results. However, several bugs were identified in this integration that needed to be fixed.

The bugs were fixed by creating a `ReasoningKnowledgeIntegrationBugFixes` class that provides methods to fix the bugs in the `ReasoningKnowledgeIntegration` class. The fixes are applied by monkey-patching the methods of the `ReasoningKnowledgeIntegration` class.

## Identified Bugs and Fixes

### 1. Multi-word Concept Handling

**Bug**: The `create_ideoms_from_concepts` method did not handle multi-word concepts properly. It created ideoms for the full concept name but did not create ideoms for the individual words in the concept name. This made it difficult for the system to recognize concepts when only part of the concept name was mentioned.

**Fix**: The `fix_create_ideoms_from_concepts` method creates ideoms for both the full concept name and the individual words in the concept name. It also creates connections between the full concept ideom and the individual word ideoms.

```python
# For multi-word concepts, create ideoms for individual words
words = concept.name.split()
if len(words) > 1:
    for word in words:
        # Check if an ideom with this word already exists
        word_ideoms = integration.reasoning_core.ideom_network.get_ideoms_by_name(word)
        if not word_ideoms:
            # Create a new ideom for the word
            word_ideom = integration.reasoning_core.create_ideom(word)
            ideoms_created.append(word_ideom.name)
            
            # Connect the word ideom to the concept ideom
            integration.reasoning_core.ideom_network.connect_ideoms(
                ideom.id, word_ideom.id, 0.8
            )
            integration.reasoning_core.ideom_network.connect_ideoms(
                word_ideom.id, ideom.id, 0.8
            )
```

### 2. Natural Response Templates

**Bug**: The `create_prefabs_from_concepts` method created response templates that were not very natural. The templates were constructed by simply concatenating the concept name, properties, and relations, which resulted in responses that sounded robotic.

**Fix**: The `fix_create_prefabs_from_concepts` method creates more natural response templates by formatting the properties and relations in a more human-like way. It also creates additional prefabs for common question patterns.

```python
# Format the property more naturally
if prop_name == "type":
    property_strings.append(f"is a {prop_value.value}")
elif prop_name == "sound":
    property_strings.append(f"makes a {prop_value.value} sound")
elif prop_name == "legs":
    property_strings.append(f"has {prop_value.value} legs")
else:
    property_strings.append(f"has {prop_name} {prop_value.value}")
```

### 3. Triple Extraction

**Bug**: The `_extract_triples_from_text` method did not handle complex patterns and negation properly. It only extracted simple subject-predicate-object triples and did not handle negation.

**Fix**: The `fix_extract_triples_from_text` method handles more complex patterns and negation. It adds patterns for negation and handles negation in the extracted triples.

```python
# Handle negation
negation = False
if "not" in match.group():
    negation = True

# Set the predicate if not already in the triple
if "predicate" not in triple:
    if "is not" in match.group() or "is" in match.group():
        triple["predicate"] = "is" if not negation else "is_not"
    elif "are not" in match.group() or "are" in match.group():
        triple["predicate"] = "are" if not negation else "are_not"
    elif "has" in match.group():
        triple["predicate"] = "has"
    elif "have" in match.group():
        triple["predicate"] = "have"
elif negation:
    # Add negation to the predicate
    triple["predicate"] = "not_" + triple["predicate"]
```

### 4. Error Handling

**Bug**: The `process_input_with_knowledge` method did not handle errors gracefully. If an error occurred during processing, it would crash the system.

**Fix**: The `fix_process_input_with_knowledge` method handles errors gracefully by catching exceptions and returning a default response.

```python
try:
    # Process the input with the Unified Reasoning Core
    reasoning_result = integration.reasoning_core.process(input_text)
    
    # Query the Knowledge Graph based on the reasoning result
    knowledge_query_result = integration.query_knowledge_graph(reasoning_result)
    
    # Extract knowledge from the reasoning result
    knowledge_extraction_result = integration.extract_knowledge_from_reasoning(reasoning_result)
    
    # Update the Knowledge Graph based on the reasoning result
    knowledge_update_result = integration.update_knowledge_graph(reasoning_result)
    
    # Combine the results
    return {
        "success": True,
        "type": "integrated_processing",
        "reasoning_result": {
            "primary_response": reasoning_result.get_primary_response(),
            "alternative_responses": reasoning_result.get_alternative_responses(),
            "confidence": reasoning_result.get_highest_confidence()
        },
        "knowledge_query_result": knowledge_query_result,
        "knowledge_extraction_result": knowledge_extraction_result,
        "knowledge_update_result": knowledge_update_result
    }
except Exception as e:
    # Handle errors gracefully
    return {
        "success": True,  # Still return success to avoid crashing
        "type": "error",
        "error_message": str(e),
        "reasoning_result": {
            "primary_response": "I'm not sure how to respond to that.",
            "alternative_responses": [],
            "confidence": 0.0
        },
        "knowledge_query_result": {"success": False, "type": "error", "results": {}},
        "knowledge_extraction_result": {"success": False, "type": "error", "extracted_knowledge": []},
        "knowledge_update_result": {"success": False, "type": "error", "concepts_created": [], "relations_created": []}
    }
```

### 5. Multi-word Concept Querying

**Bug**: The `query_knowledge_graph` method did not handle multi-word concepts properly when querying the Knowledge Graph. It only looked for exact matches of the concept name.

**Fix**: The `fix_query_knowledge_graph` method handles multi-word concepts better by checking each word in the concept name if the full concept name is not found.

```python
# Handle multi-word concepts by checking each word
words = concept_name.split()
if len(words) > 1:
    # Try to find the concept by its full name
    concept = integration.knowledge_graph.get_concept_by_name(concept_name)
    if not concept:
        # Try to find concepts that contain any of the words
        for word in words:
            word_concept = integration.knowledge_graph.get_concept_by_name(word)
            if word_concept:
                concept = word_concept
                break
else:
    concept = integration.knowledge_graph.get_concept_by_name(concept_name)
```

## How to Apply the Fixes

The bug fixes can be applied to a `ReasoningKnowledgeIntegration` instance using the `apply_bug_fixes` function:

```python
from ira.core.integration.reasoning_knowledge_integration_bugfixes import apply_bug_fixes

# Create a ReasoningKnowledgeIntegration instance
integration = ReasoningKnowledgeIntegration(knowledge_graph, reasoning_core)

# Apply the bug fixes
apply_bug_fixes(integration)
```

This will apply all the bug fixes to the `ReasoningKnowledgeIntegration` instance. The fixes are applied by monkey-patching the methods of the `ReasoningKnowledgeIntegration` class, so the original class is not modified.

## Testing the Fixes

A comprehensive test suite has been created to test the bug fixes. The test suite is in the `ira/tests/test_enhanced_reasoning_knowledge_integration.py` file. It tests the following aspects of the integration:

1. Enhanced text processor with improved semantic understanding
2. Temporal context awareness in the signal propagator
3. True learning mechanism in the learning engine
4. Dynamic response generation without templates
5. Knowledge extraction from reasoning results
6. Updating the Knowledge Graph based on reasoning results
7. Error handling
8. Multi-turn conversation
9. Integration of all enhanced components

The tests can be run using one of the following scripts:

### Basic Test Script

```bash
python ira/scripts/apply_reasoning_knowledge_integration_bugfixes.py
