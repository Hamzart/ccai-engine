# Testing Strategy for CCAI Engine Architecture

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the CCAI Engine architecture overhaul. It provides a detailed plan for testing the system to ensure it meets the requirements and works as expected.

## 1. Testing Approach

The testing approach for the CCAI Engine architecture overhaul will follow a multi-layered strategy that combines different testing levels and types. The approach will be:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure that the implementation meets the requirements.
2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.
3. **Shift-Left Testing**: Start testing early in the development process to identify and fix issues before they become more costly.
4. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus testing efforts on high-risk areas of the system.
5. **Exploratory Testing**: Complement automated testing with exploratory testing to find issues that automated tests might miss.
