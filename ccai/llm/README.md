# CCAI Language Module Documentation

## Overview

The CCAI Language Module is a custom-built natural language processing system based on the IRA (Ideom Resolver AI) philosophy. This module provides natural language understanding and generation capabilities without relying on external APIs or large neural networks, making it suitable for embedded applications.

## Core Concepts

### IRA Philosophy

The IRA (Ideom Resolver AI) philosophy is based on the following key concepts:

1. **Ideoms**: Atomic symbolic units of cognition that represent fundamental concepts. These are the building blocks of knowledge and language understanding.

2. **Prefabs**: Conceptual templates composed of ideoms that represent recognizable patterns or higher-level concepts. Prefabs are activated when their constituent ideoms are activated in specific patterns.

3. **Signal Propagation**: A mechanism that simulates the convergence of ideoms to activate prefab nodes. This is how the system "reasons" about concepts and generates responses.

### Architecture

The language module consists of several key components:

1. **IRALanguageCore**: The core implementation that manages ideoms and prefabs, and implements the signal propagation mechanism.

2. **IRALanguageUnderstanding**: Responsible for natural language understanding, including query parsing and knowledge extraction.

3. **IRALanguageGeneration**: Handles natural language generation based on structured data.

4. **IRALanguageModule**: A unified interface that integrates understanding and generation capabilities.

5. **LLMInterface**: The main interface that applications use to interact with the language module.

## Key Features

### Pattern-Based Natural Language Understanding

The system uses a combination of pattern matching and semantic similarity to understand natural language queries. It identifies query types, extracts entities, and converts natural language into structured representations.

### Template-Based Language Generation

Responses are generated using templates that are filled with relevant information. The system selects appropriate templates based on the query type and available data.

### Knowledge Extraction

The system can extract structured knowledge from natural language text in the form of triplets (subject, relation, object). This knowledge is used to build and expand the concept graph.

### Signal Propagation for Reasoning

The system uses signal propagation to simulate reasoning. Signals are propagated through the network of ideoms, activating prefabs that represent higher-level concepts or patterns.

### Symbolic Knowledge Representation

Knowledge is represented symbolically using ideoms and their connections, rather than distributed representations in neural networks. This makes the system more interpretable and controllable.

## Usage

### Initialization

```python
from ccai.llm.interface import LLMInterface

# Initialize the language module
llm = LLMInterface()
```

### Parsing Queries

```python
# Parse a natural language query
query = "What is a dog?"
parsed_query = llm.parse_query(query)
print(parsed_query)
# Output: {'entity': 'dog', 'query_type': 'definition', 'attributes': {}}
```

### Generating Responses

```python
# Generate a response from structured data
data = {
    'response_type': 'definition',
    'entity': 'dog',
    'definition': 'a domesticated carnivorous mammal that typically has a long snout, an acute sense of smell, and a barking, howling, or whining voice'
}
response = llm.generate_response(data)
print(response)
# Output: "A dog is a domesticated carnivorous mammal that typically has a long snout, an acute sense of smell, and a barking, howling, or whining voice."
```

### Extracting Knowledge

```python
# Extract knowledge from text
text = "Dogs are mammals that have fur and can bark."
triplets = llm.extract_knowledge(text)
print(triplets)
# Output: [
#   {'subject': 'dogs', 'relation': 'is_a', 'object': 'mammals'},
#   {'subject': 'dogs', 'relation': 'has_part', 'object': 'fur'},
#   {'subject': 'dogs', 'relation': 'can_do', 'object': 'bark'}
# ]
```

### Training the Model

```python
# Train the model on new data
training_texts = [
    "A cat is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.",
    "Cats have retractable claws and can purr.",
    "Cats are often kept as pets."
]
llm.model.train(training_texts)
```

## Implementation Details

### Ideom Implementation

Ideoms are implemented as objects with the following properties:
- Name: The name of the ideom
- Category: The category of the ideom (entity, action, property, etc.)
- Activation: The current activation level (0.0 to 1.0)
- Connections: Connected ideoms and their weights

### Prefab Implementation

Prefabs are implemented as objects with the following properties:
- Name: The name of the prefab
- Pattern: A dictionary mapping ideom names to their required activation weights
- Category: The category of the prefab (template, query, response, etc.)
- Activation: The current activation level (0.0 to 1.0)
- Threshold: The activation threshold for the prefab to be considered activated

### Signal Propagation

Signal propagation works as follows:
1. Ideoms are activated based on input text
2. Activation spreads to connected ideoms based on connection weights
3. Prefabs compute their activation based on the activation of their constituent ideoms
4. Prefabs that exceed their activation threshold are considered activated
5. The system uses activated prefabs to understand queries or generate responses

## Customization

### Adding New Ideoms

```python
# Add a new ideom
ideom = core.add_ideom("happiness", "emotion")
```

### Adding New Prefabs

```python
# Add a new prefab
pattern = {
    "happy": 0.8,
    "joy": 0.7,
    "smile": 0.5
}
prefab = core.add_prefab("happiness_concept", pattern, "emotion")
```

### Adding New Templates

Templates can be added to the IRALanguageGeneration component:

```python
generation.response_templates["emotion"] = [
    "{entity} is an emotion characterized by {properties}.",
    "The emotion of {entity} is typically associated with {properties}."
]
```

## Performance Considerations

- The system is designed to be lightweight and suitable for embedded applications
- It uses simple pattern matching and template-based generation, which are computationally efficient
- Knowledge extraction is rule-based and does not require large neural networks
- The system can be extended with more sophisticated algorithms as needed

## Limitations

- The system has limited understanding of complex language constructs
- It relies on predefined patterns and templates, which may not cover all possible inputs
- Knowledge extraction is based on simple patterns and may miss complex relationships
- The system does not have the same level of language understanding as large neural networks

## Recent Enhancements

The IRA language module has been significantly improved with the following enhancements:

### Enhanced Pattern Matching

- **Multi-word Entity Support**: Added preprocessing for multi-word entities like "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "police officer", etc.
- **Complex Relationship Extraction**: Improved pattern matching to handle more complex relationships like "X drives Y", "X is alive", and "X is a type of Y".
- **Compound Statement Handling**: Enhanced extraction of multiple relationships from compound statements (e.g., "X has Y and Z", "X can Y and Z").
- **Contrasting Property Support**: Added support for contrasting properties in statements like "X is Y but not Z".

### Improved Query Handling

- **Direct Query Handling**: Added direct handling for common query types like "what is X?", "is X a Y?", and "can X Y?".
- **Verification Query Enhancement**: Improved handling of verification queries with better pattern matching and response generation.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented multiple layers of fallback mechanisms to ensure meaningful responses even when the core IRA module doesn't have a perfect match.

### Better Response Generation

- **Enhanced Templates**: Added more natural-sounding response templates for various query types.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Improved response generation to be more context-aware and informative.
- **Common Knowledge Integration**: Enhanced integration with common_knowledge.txt to provide more accurate and comprehensive responses.

### System Integration

- **Hybrid Processing**: Updated the main application to use both the traditional concept graph and the enhanced IRA language module, providing more robust and accurate responses.
- **Knowledge Extraction Improvements**: Enhanced knowledge extraction to capture more relationships and properties from text.
- **Lowered Activation Threshold**: Reduced the activation threshold for prefabs to make them activate more easily, improving the system's ability to recognize patterns.

## Future Improvements
