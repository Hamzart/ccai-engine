# CCAI Chatbot Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for transforming the Cognitive Concept AI (CCAI) engine into a fully functional AI chatbot.

## Overview

The current CCAI engine provides a solid foundation with its concept graph, reasoning subsystems, and NLP capabilities. To transform it into a fully functional chatbot, we need to add several new components and enhance existing ones.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Conversational Interface

The conversational interface will be the entry point for user interactions and will manage the flow of the conversation.

#### Components:
- **DialogManager**: Orchestrates the conversation flow, tracks conversation state, and decides when to query the knowledge base vs. when to generate responses directly.
- **ContextTracker**: Maintains conversation history and resolves references (like pronouns) to entities mentioned earlier in the conversation.
- **IntentClassifier**: Identifies the user's intent (question, statement, command, etc.) to route the input appropriately.

```python
# ccai/conversation/dialog_manager.py
class DialogManager:
    def __init__(self, reasoning_core, nlg_engine, context_tracker):
        self.reasoning_core = reasoning_core
        self.nlg_engine = nlg_engine
        self.context_tracker = context_tracker
        
    def process_message(self, user_message: str) -> str:
        # Update context with new message
        self.context_tracker.add_user_message(user_message)
        
        # Classify intent
        intent = self.intent_classifier.classify(user_message)
        
        # Process based on intent
        if intent == "QUESTION":
            return self.handle_question(user_message)
        elif intent == "STATEMENT":
            return self.handle_statement(user_message)
        elif intent == "COMMAND":
            return self.handle_command(user_message)
        else:
            return self.nlg_engine.generate_fallback_response()
```

### 2. Natural Language Generation (NLG)

The NLG module will transform the structured knowledge and reasoning results into natural, human-like responses.

#### Components:
- **ResponseGenerator**: Converts reasoning results into natural language responses.
- **TemplateEngine**: Uses templates for common response patterns.
- **VariationGenerator**: Adds variety to responses to make the chatbot feel more natural.

```python
# ccai/nlg/generator.py
class ResponseGenerator:
    def __init__(self, template_engine, variation_generator):
        self.template_engine = template_engine
        self.variation_generator = variation_generator
        
    def generate_response(self, reasoning_results, context):
        # Select appropriate template based on query type and results
        template = self.template_engine.select_template(reasoning_results, context)
        
        # Fill in template with actual data
        response = self.template_engine.fill_template(template, reasoning_results)
        
        # Add variations to make response more natural
        response = self.variation_generator.apply_variations(response, context)
        
        return response
```

### 3. Enhanced Reasoning

Expand the reasoning capabilities to handle more complex queries and inferences.

#### Components:
- **HypotheticalReasoner**: Handles "what if" scenarios and counterfactual reasoning.
- **AnalogicalReasoner**: Finds similarities between concepts to answer comparison questions.
- **TemporalReasoner**: Handles time-based reasoning (before, after, during).
- **CausalReasoner**: Understands cause-effect relationships.

### 4. External Knowledge Integration

Connect to external knowledge sources to supplement the internal concept graph.

#### Components:
- **KnowledgeConnector**: Interface for external knowledge sources.
- **WikipediaConnector**: Retrieves information from Wikipedia.
- **WebSearchConnector**: Performs web searches for current information.
- **KnowledgeFusion**: Combines internal and external knowledge.

### 5. User Experience

Improve the user experience with personalization and a web interface.

#### Components:
- **UserProfileManager**: Maintains user preferences and interaction history.
- **WebInterface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for the chatbot.
- **SentimentAnalyzer**: Detects user sentiment to adjust responses accordingly.

## Data Flow

1. User sends a message through the interface
2. DialogManager processes the message and updates context
3. IntentClassifier determines the type of message
4. For questions:
   - QueryParser converts the question to a structured query
   - ReasoningCore processes the query using the concept graph
   - If needed, external knowledge is retrieved
   - ResponseGenerator creates a natural language response
5. For statements:
   - InformationExtractor extracts knowledge from the statement
   - ConceptGraph is updated with new knowledge
   - ResponseGenerator acknowledges the information
6. DialogManager sends the response back to the user

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Conversational Components**
   - Implement DialogManager, ContextTracker, and IntentClassifier
   - Create basic ResponseGenerator with templates

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Reasoning**
   - Implement additional reasoning subsystems
   - Improve query parsing for complex questions

3. **Phase 3: External Knowledge**
   - Implement connectors for external knowledge sources
   - Create knowledge fusion mechanism

4. **Phase 4: User Experience**
   - Develop web interface
   - Add personalization features
   - Implement sentiment analysis

5. **Phase 5: Refinement**
   - Optimize performance
   - Improve response quality
   - Add more knowledge sources

## Conclusion

This architecture builds upon the existing CCAI engine to create a fully functional AI chatbot. By adding conversational capabilities, enhanced reasoning, and external knowledge integration, the system will be able to engage in natural, informative conversations with users.
