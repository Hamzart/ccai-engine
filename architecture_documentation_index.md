# CCAI Engine Architecture Documentation Index

## Introduction

The CCAI Engine is undergoing a complete architecture overhaul to create a truly intelligent system based on the IRA (Ideom Resolver AI) philosophy. The current implementation relies too heavily on hardcoded patterns and templates, resulting in a system that lacks true intelligence and adaptability. The new architecture simplifies the component structure from many complex components to just three core components, while significantly enhancing the system's capabilities.

This document serves as an index to all the architecture documentation created for the CCAI Engine architecture overhaul. It provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture design, implementation plan, and supporting documents.

## Key Concepts and Principles

### Ideom-Based Cognition

The foundation of the new architecture is the concept of ideoms, which are atomic units of cognition. Ideoms can be activated and connected to form complex thoughts. The key aspects of ideom-based cognition are:

- **Ideoms**: Atomic units of cognition with activation levels and connections to other ideoms
- **Signal Propagation**: Signals propagate through the ideom network, activating related concepts
- **Prefab Activation**: Patterns of ideom activation trigger higher-level prefabs, which represent complex concepts or responses
- **Dynamic Learning**: The system continuously learns from experience, adjusting ideom connections and creating new prefabs

### Flexible Knowledge Representation

The Knowledge Graph provides a flexible representation of knowledge that can handle ambiguity and uncertainty. The key aspects of flexible knowledge representation are:

- **Concept Nodes**: Represent entities, ideas, or objects with properties and relations
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Properties and relations have confidence scores, allowing the system to represent and reason with uncertain knowledge
- **Self-Organizing Structure**: The knowledge graph can reorganize itself based on new knowledge and learning
- **Semantic Similarity**: The system can find similar concepts based on semantic similarity

### Context-Aware Conversations

The Conversation Manager maintains context across interactions for coherent conversations. The key aspects of context-aware conversations are:

- **Conversation Context**: Represents the current state of a conversation, including messages, entities, topics, and user information
- **Intent Recognition**: The system can recognize the intent behind a user's message
- **Response Planning**: The system can plan responses based on the user's intent and the conversation context
- **Memory Management**: The system can manage short-term and long-term memory for effective conversation handling

### Continuous Learning

The system continuously learns from experience, improving over time. The key aspects of continuous learning are:

- **Learning from Activation**: The system learns from patterns of ideom activation
- **Learning from Feedback**: The system learns from explicit feedback
- **Prefab Creation**: The system creates new prefabs from successful patterns
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: The system acquires new knowledge from interactions and external sources
