# Migration Plan for CCAI Engine Architecture Overhaul

This document outlines the comprehensive migration plan for transitioning from the current CCAI Engine architecture to the new architecture. It provides a detailed plan for migrating data, code, and deployment strategies to ensure a smooth transition.

## 1. Migration Approach

### 1.1 Migration Strategy

The migration from the current architecture to the new architecture will follow a phased approach with parallel operation of both systems during the transition period. This approach minimizes risk and allows for validation of the new system before full cutover.

The migration strategy consists of the following phases:

1. **Preparation Phase**: Set up the new architecture in a development environment, implement core functionality, and prepare for data migration.
2. **Parallel Operation Phase**: Run both the current and new systems in parallel, with the new system initially in read-only mode.
3. **Gradual Transition Phase**: Gradually shift traffic from the current system to the new system, starting with non-critical functionality.
4. **Cutover Phase**: Complete the transition to the new system and decommission the current system.
5. **Optimization Phase**: Optimize the new system based on production usage and feedback.

### 1.2 Migration Principles

The migration will be guided by the following principles:

1. **Minimize Risk**: Prioritize approaches that minimize risk to the production system.
2. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Maintain data integrity throughout the migration process.
3. **Validate Thoroughly**: Validate the new system thoroughly before transitioning production traffic.
4. **Provide Rollback Options**: Ensure that rollback options are available at each stage of the migration.
5. **Minimize Downtime**: Design the migration process to minimize downtime for users.
6. **Communicate Clearly**: Communicate migration plans, progress, and issues clearly to all stakeholders.

### 1.3 Migration Timeline
